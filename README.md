# Emulation of an Undergraduate CS Curriculum (EUCC)

This is another list on the internet (among thousands of others) that compiles courses and books from various sources to help you achieve your self-study goals.

# Background

I completed my undergraduate degree (B. Tech IT) in 2022. Due to COVID-19, I (we) spent almost half of my (our) college days at home, attending online lectures. Even though it was hard at first, people adapted to the situation pretty quickly and pretty well. Given that experience, I can now say that it is indeed possible to learn stuff by ourselves with enough discipline and willpower. Hence, one fine day, I decided to make a list that took freakin' forever to make!

# Is this a substitute for college education?

Now, don't get me wrong! This list is by no means a substitute for a real college education. I've seen the best of both worlds, and this is just an attempt to provide you the best of one of those worlds. I strongly suggest you get a college education if you have the necessary resources. You can learn things by yourself anytime at your will, but you can't say the same about college education. The peers and the teaching assistance that you get are invaluable. We often undervalue the elements of teamwork, conflict management and sharing responsibilities that a college education provides. The other thing is we can only do so much with our willpower. It drains out pretty fast (sad emoji). So, college > self-learning for most people.

# Target audience

Both beginners and experienced professionals can make use of this list. This gives you an overall picture (that I didn't have back then) of how the foundational subjects are connected and some of the best (mostly free) resources to teach those subjects to yourself. This list can save you from the search spiral for the best resources on the internet. Pick a course from the lot and go to depths no one had ever reached.

> [!WARNING] Note
> *This list is by no means exhaustive. It is more like a stripped-down version of a UG program. The myriad of electives, majors and minors are all gone.*

# Getting the best out of these resources

Stop treating video lectures as your primary resource. Of course, they are helpful, but learning doesn't happen there. Take time to solve the problem sets or exercises that come along with a course or a book. [Real learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5OJJD3Eytk) happens when you put effort into solving them and while you sleep (you must sleep well - extremely important). The problems you work on shouldn't be too hard or too easy. The problem should feel hard and doable (find a sweet spot), and it is absolutely fine to look at a solution sometimes.
